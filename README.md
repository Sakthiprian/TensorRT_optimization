# YOLOv8 TensorRT Optimization

This project demonstrates how to optimize a YOLOv8 model using **TensorRT**, a high-performance deep learning inference library developed by NVIDIA. By converting the YOLOv8 model into a TensorRT engine, we can leverage CUDA and GPU acceleration to perform efficient and fast inference for object detection tasks.


## Introduction to TensorRT

**TensorRT** is a deep learning inference optimizer and runtime library developed by NVIDIA. It allows for the deployment of trained deep learning models in high-performance applications by optimizing models specifically for the target GPU hardware. TensorRT achieves this by performing optimizations such as:

- **Layer fusion**: Merging layers that can be computed together to reduce memory bandwidth.
- **Precision calibration**: Reducing floating-point precision (e.g., from FP32 to FP16 or INT8) to accelerate computations while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
- **Kernel auto-tuning**: Selecting the best kernel implementation for each operation, tailored to the specific hardware.
- **Dynamic tensor memory management**: Efficient memory allocation and deallocation to reduce memory footprint.

Using TensorRT with YOLOv8 enables significantly faster inference speeds compared to standard PyTorch or ONNX runtimes.
